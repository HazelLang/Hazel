# The Hazel Language Design 


## Importing
We shall use the ``import`` keyword to import Hazel modules and the ``include <file.hz>`` syntax to use an existing
``.hz`` file.

For example: 
```cpp
// This imports a dummy package called "Latte" 
import Latte

// This uses a single Hazel file "latte.hz"
include <latte.hz>
```

Note that to include multiple Hazel files, you'll need to add the ``include <file.hz>`` syntax for as many ``.hz`` 
files you intend to add to your project
